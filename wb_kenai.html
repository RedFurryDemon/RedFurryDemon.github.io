			<h2>environment</h2>

			<p>K-143 is a large telluric planet orbiting one of the components of a binary star - a main-sequence star; the other component is a brown dwarf significantly further away. The planet's axis is strongly tilted; because of this, polar ice caps are absent. The climate is warm and humid. Its atmosphere supports carbon-based life.</p>

			<p>Over 85% of the surface is covered in water. Relatively small tectonic plates lead to high volcanic activity and fragmented landmasses: chains of islands of volcanic, tectonic, or coral origin.</p>

			<h2>life</h2>

			<h3>saline environment</h3>
			<p>The primary source of fresh water is precipitation; many lifeforms thrive on saltwater, including all vertebrates. Tetrapods evolved from saltwater fish (as there were no freshwater fish to begin with) and are adapted to the excretion of excess salt through kidneys.</p>

			<h3>reproduction</h3>
			<p>Anisogamy is predominant. In all vertebrates and almost all main groups of invertebrates, both types of gametes are produced by an individual organism. Vertebrates are typically simultaneous hermaphrodites with self-fertilization being impossible. Both sequential and simultaneous hermaphroditism occur in invertebrates.</p>
