			<p>0.0 Terminology<br>
				-unless noted otherwise, all taxons (groups) are defined in a cladist approach ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade ; &quot;all birds are reptiles&quot;, etc.)<br>
				-primitive vs derived distinction is explained here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_(phylogenetics)</p>

			<hr>

			<p>0.1 Environment<br>
				- Earth as we know it does not exist in that reality; this is to avoid probability concerns when I plagiarize natural history (->organisms on two planets evolving certain features in exactly the same manner).<br>
				- the planet (working name: Kenai) has, generally speaking, similar parametres as Earth<br>
				- the landmasses are mostly fragmented; chains of islands rather than conventional continents (small tectonic plates?)<br>
				->high volcaninc activity<br>
				-islands may be of volcanic, tectonic, or coral origin<br>
				-sea saltiness undecided (maybe make it a freshwater ocean, lol)</p>

			<p>0.2 Eukaryotes in general<br>
				-still undecided whether angiosperms are present at all<br>
				-pioneer organisms are quite favored due to volcanism; lichens, algae, sarcopterygii, insects, semi-aquatic and flying reptiles<br>
				-invertebrates so far undecided, presumably most or groups from natural history<br>
				-many, many dragonflies for no reason other than the fact I love dragonflies<br>
				-trilobites extant and doing pretty well<br>
				- fish are mainly sarcopterygii and fish with appearance similar to placoderms; phylogeny &amp; physiology so far mostly undecided<br>
				-(if sea saltiness is high) amphibians either completely extinct or strongly favored against due to loss of water through osmosis<br>
				-mammals overshadowed by draconids (ref. synapsids in Mesosoic); small omnivores<br>
				-there is a location (tectonic island/s; name?) in which a radiation ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_radiation ) of synapsids took place due to geographical isolation for a sufficient period of time (how long?)</p>

			<hr>

			<p>1.1 Draconids in relation to other reptiles<br>
				The draconid clade is the most advanced taxon within the reptile phylogenetic tree. Draconids are found in almost all environments and greatly vary in size, diet, and social behavior. It is accurate to say that my draconids have the same place as dinosaurs in natural history.</p>

			<p>Primitive traits of reptiles in general:<br>
				-amniotes<br>
				-ectothermic<br>
				-oviparous<br>
				-simultaneous hermaphrodites without self-fertilization</p>

			<p>(ref.) Overall appearance of early draconids resembles a heavily-plated varan, iguana, or crocodilian.</p>

			<p>1.2 Primitive traits of draconids (working name of the c. a.: ancestor A)<br>
				-four legs on the sides of the body (like lizards)<br>
				-reasonably large scales<br>
				-horns and spikes<br>
				-diet undecided; herbivorous? insectivorous?<br>
				-size undecided</p>

			<hr>

			<p>2.1 great serpents, aka wyrms<br>
				-no close relation to snakes!<br>
				-many species are aquatic; some terrestrial and/or arboreal<br>
				-regardless of preferred environment, generally good swimmers<br>
				-carnivorous (exclusively?)</p>

			<p>primitive traits:<br>
				-no legs<br>
				-horns (not present in all species)</p>

			<p>derived traits:<br>
				-prehensile tail (mainly terrestrial and arboreal species); used also to help launching themselves at prey<br>
				-tail fin (aquatic)</p>

			<hr>

			<p>2.2 wyverns</p>

			<p>primitive traits:<br>
				-membranous wing-like structures</p>

			<p>derived traits:<br>
				-membranous wings (front limbs)<br>
				-membranous thingies on tail<br>
				-membranous crests<br>
				-leaf-shaped tail tip<br>
				-other flight adaptations (which ones? probably no keel)<br>
				-note: all ectotherms; membranes also used to raise body temperature quickly in the sun (and lower it in the wind like a radiator?)</p>

			<hr>

			<p>2.3 drakes<br>
				-limbs straight under the body</p>

			<p>primitive traits:<br>
				-quadrupedal<br>
				-medium(/large? why? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s_rule ) size<br>
				-scales<br>
				-horns<br>
				-diet undecided</p>

			<p>derived traits:<br>
				-endothermy<br>
				-feathers (dravirs)<br>
				-active flight (birds)<br>
				-bipedal (dravirs)<br>
				-sapience (the kobold)</p>

			<hr>

			<p>2.3.1 clades of drakes</p>

			<p>lindwurms<br>
				-fur (single-strand feathers) for thermal insulation<br>
				-they do very well in cold climates<br>
				-spread through frozen sea</p>

			<p>griffins<br>
				-compound feathers (ref. bird feathers)<br>
				-quadrupedal<br>
				-herbivorous</p>

			<p>dravirs<br>
				-TL;DR RFD's edition of Maniraptora</p>

			<p>birds<br>
				-active flight<br>
				-sternal keel, air sacs, &amp; other adaptations<br>
				-appearance similar to Archeopteryx &amp; co. (long tail, claws on forelimbs, teeth)</p>

			<p>the kobold<br>
				-genus or species of a dravir that has developed sapience and some sort of civilization<br>
				-upright position<br>
				-primarily nocturnal?<br>
				-terrestrial<br>
				-highly polymorphic</p>
